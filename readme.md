# Demo Components for [JCB](https://github.com/vdm-io/Joomla-Component-Builder)

You can now with much ease import components in to JCB that are already mapped. You can then adapt these components to your needs.

## Watch [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/lkE0ZiSWufg) on how to add these components to your JCB install.

Some of these packages need a key to buy access to these keys please contact Llewellyn at [joomla@vdm.io](mailto:joomla@vdm.io)
